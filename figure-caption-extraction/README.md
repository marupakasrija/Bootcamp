# Figure Captions Extraction System

## Purpose

This module builds a production-ready system to extract, store, and provide access to figure captions and related metadata from scientific publicationsâ€”especially PubMed Central (PMC). The system is designed to be extensible, secure, and operable via API, CLI, or batch jobs.

## What This System Does

- Extracts **title**, **abstract**, and **figure captions** from PMC articles.
- Extracts **figure URLs** and **key biological entities** (e.g., genes) from captions.
- Makes the data accessible via API (JSON/CSV) and CLI.

> ðŸ”— Uses [BioC-PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/bionlp/APIs/BioC-PMC/) for structural data and [PubTator API](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator3/api) for entity extraction.

## User Capabilities

- Submit PMC or PMID paper IDs for processing.
- Query results via a password/API-key protected REST API.
- Download extracted data in JSON or CSV.
- Upload IDs via API, CLI, or file.

## Admin Capabilities

- Configure data storage (default: DuckDB).
- Set API key/password, logging levels, and data sources.
- Add new sources without major system changes.

## Ops Capabilities

- Deploy with Docker.
- Run ingestion in batch mode (file, API, watched folder).
- Monitor logs and job summaries.
- Ensure clean exit statuses for jobs.
