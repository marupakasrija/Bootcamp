This new figure was made with matplotlib using approximated data. The data is made of four series (men deaths/cases, women deaths/cases) that could have been displayed using classical double column (deaths/cases) bar plots. However, the layout used here is better for the intended audience. It exploits the fact that the number of new cases is always greater than the corresponding number of deaths to mix the two values. It also takes advantage of the reading direction (English [left-to-right] for NYT) in order to ease comparison between men and women while the central labels give an immediate access to the main message of the figure (cancer). This is a self-contained figure that delivers a clear message on cancer deaths. However, it is not precise. The chosen layout makes it actually difficult to estimate the number of kidney cancer deaths because of its bottom position and the location of the labelled ticks at the top.

This logarithmic mapping plays a major role in saccade decision.

The rainbow colormap (qualitative) and the seismic colormap (diverging) are equally bad for such a signal because they tend to hide details in the high frequency domain (bottom-right part). Using a sequential colormap such as the purple one, it is easier to see details in the high frequency domain. Adapted from [5] .",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4161295/bin/pcbi.1003833.g005.jpg,2025-05-20 20:07:58.370
PMC4161295_pcbi-1003833-g006,PMC4161295,"Do not mislead the reader. On the left part of the figure, we represented a series of four values: 30, 20, 15, 10. On the upper left part, we used the disc area to represent the value, while in the bottom part we used the disc radius. Results are visually very different. In the latter case (red circles), the last value (10) appears very small compared to the first one (30), while the ratio between the two values is only 3∶1. This situation is actually very frequent in the literature because the command (or interface) used to produce circles or scatter plots (with varying point sizes) offers to use the radius as default to specify the disc size. It thus appears logical to use the value for the radius, but this is misleading. On the right part of the figure, we display a series of ten values using the full range for values on the top part (y axis goes from 0 to 100) or a partial range in the bottom part (y axis goes from 80 to 100), and we explicitly did not label the y-axis to enhance the confusion. The visual perception of the two series is totally different. In the top part (black series), we tend to interpret the values as very similar, while in the bottom part, we tend to believe there are significant differences. Even if we had used labels to indicate the actual range, the effect would persist because the bars are the most salient information on these figures.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4161295/bin/pcbi.1003833.g006.jpg,2025-05-20 20:07:58.530
PMC4161295_pcbi-1003833-g007,PMC4161295,"Avoid chartjunk. We have seven series of samples that are equally important, and we would like to show them all in order to visually compare them (exact signal values are supposed to be given elsewhere). The left figure demonstrates what is certainly one of the worst possible designs. All the curves cover each other and the different colors (that have been badly and automatically chosen by the software) do not help to distinguish them. The legend box overlaps part of the graphic, making it impossible to check if there is any interesting information in this area. There are far too many ticks: x labels overlap each other, making them unreadable, and the three-digit precision does not seem to carry any significant information. Finally, the grid does not help because (among other criticisms) it is not aligned with the signal, which can be considered discrete given the small number of sample points. The right figure adopts a radically different layout while using the same area on the sheet of paper. Series have been split into seven plots, each of them showing one series, while other series are drawn very lightly behind the main one. Series labels have been put on the left of each plot, avoiding the use of colors and a legend box. The number of x ticks has been reduced to three, and a thin line indicates these three values for all plots. Finally, y ticks have been completely removed and the height of the gray background boxes indicate the [−1,+1] range (this should also be indicated in the figure caption if it were to be used in an article).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4161295/bin/pcbi.1003833.g007.jpg,2025-05-20 20:07:58.683
