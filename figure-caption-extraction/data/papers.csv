PMC2876325,S-layer stabilized lipid membranes (Review),"The present review focuses on a unique bio-molecular construction kit based on surface-layer (S-layer) proteins as building blocks and patterning elements, but also major classes of biological molecules such as lipids, membrane-active peptides and membrane proteins, and glycans for the design of functional supported lipid membranes. The biomimetic approach copying the supramolecular building principle of most archaeal cell envelopes merely composed of a plasma membrane and a closely associated S-layer lattice has resulted in robust and fluid lipid membranes. Most importantly, S-layer supported lipid membranes spanning an aperture or generated on solid and porous substrates constitute highly interesting model membranes for the reconstitution of responsive transmembrane proteins and membrane-active peptides. This is of particular challenge as one-third of all proteins are membrane proteins such as pore-forming proteins, ion channels, and receptors. S-layer supported lipid membranes are seen as one of the most innovative strategies in membrane protein-based nanobiotechnology with potential applications that range from pharmaceutical (high-throughput) drug screening over lipid chips to the detection of biological warfare agents.",pubmed,2025-05-17 11:13:40.545
PMC1852221,Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression and outcome in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"We compared the gene expression profile of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to normal hematopoietic and non-ALL samples using oligonucleotide arrays. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was the highest overexpressed gene in B-cell ALL compared with the other groups, and displayed heterogeneous expression, suggesting it might have prognostic relevance. CTGF expression was examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) on 79 adult ALL specimens. CTGF expression levels were significantly increased in ALL cases with B-lineage ( P < .001), unfavorable cytogenetics ( P < .001), and blasts expressing CD34 ( P < .001). In a multivariate proportional hazards model, higher CTGF expression levels corresponded to worsening of overall survival (OS; hazard ratio 1.36, for each 10-fold increase in expression; P = .019). Further studies are ongoing to confirm the prognostic value of CTGF expression in ALL and to investigate its role in normal and abnormal lymphocyte biology.",pubmed,2025-05-17 11:22:00.604
PMC7080052,Diagnosis of severe respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients,"An increasing number of critically ill patients are immunocompromised. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (ARF), chiefly due to pulmonary infection, is the leading reason for ICU admission. Identifying the cause of ARF increases the chances of survival, but may be extremely challenging, as the underlying disease, treatments, and infection combine to create complex clinical pictures. In addition, there may be more than one infectious agent, and the pulmonary manifestations may be related to both infectious and non-infectious insults. Clinically or microbiologically documented bacterial pneumonia accounts for one-third of cases of ARF in immunocompromised patients. Early antibiotic therapy is recommended but decreases the chances of identifying the causative organism(s) to about 50%. Viruses are the second most common cause of severe respiratory infections. Positive tests for a virus in respiratory samples do not necessarily indicate a role for the virus in the current acute illness. Invasive fungal infections ( Aspergillus , Mucorales , and Pneumocystis jirovecii ) account for about 15% of severe respiratory infections, whereas parasites rarely cause severe acute infections in immunocompromised patients. This review focuses on the diagnosis of severe respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients. Special attention is given to newly validated diagnostic tests designed to be used on non-invasive samples or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and capable of increasing the likelihood of an early etiological diagnosis.

Findings This analytic modeling study of a hypothetical cohort of 4990 college-age students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 students with undetected asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection suggested that frequent screening (every 2 days) of all students with a low-sensitivity, high-specificity test might be required to control outbreaks with manageable isolation dormitory utilization at a justifiable cost.

PMC7003694,Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Romanian International Knee Documentation Committee—subjective knee form,"Aim We aimed to translate and cross-culturally adapt the International Knee Documentation Committee—subjective knee form (IKDC) in Romanian. Method The original (US) IKDC—subjective knee form was translated according to recommended guidelines. Validity was tested using Spearmans’s correlation coefficient between score sand test-retest reproducibility. Reliability and internal consistency were determined using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results A total of 106 data sets were available for processing. The average age was 52 years and the male to female ratio was 40:66. Fifty-five subjects repeated the form after an average of 4 days. There were no floor or ceiling effects (range 3.4–74.7). There was a strong correlation between the first and repeated administration of the IKDC—subjective knee form ( r = 0.816, n = 50) and moderate compared to Tegner-Lysholm knee rating scale ( r = 0.506, n = 102), KOOSJR (Knee disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement, r =  − 0.622, n = 96), EuroqolEQ-5D-5L Index ( r = 0.633, n = 100) and visual analogue scale VAS ( r = 0.484, n = 99). Internal consistency was moderate with Cronbach’s alpha 0.611 ( n = 102) and ICC 0.611 for average measures (95% CI 0.493–0.713).

PMC2769033,Exercise on prescription for women aged 40-74 recruited through primary care: two year randomised controlled trial,"Objective To assess the effectiveness of a primary care based programme of exercise on prescription among relatively inactive women over a two year period. Design Randomised controlled trial. Setting 17 primary care practices in Wellington, New Zealand Participants 1089 women aged 40-74 not undertaking 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on at least five days of the week Intervention Brief physical activity intervention led by nurse with six month follow-up visit and monthly telephone support over nine months. Main outcome measure Physical activity assessed at baseline and 12 and 24 months. Secondary outcomes were quality of life (SF-36), weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, concentrations of fasting serum lipids, glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ), glucose, insulin, and physical fitness. Results Mean age was 58.9 (SD 7) years. Trial retention rates were 93% and 89% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. At baseline, 10% of intervention participants and 11% of control participants were achieving 150 minutes of at least moderate intensity physical activity a week. At 12 months rates increased to 43% and 30% and at 24 months to 39.3% and 32.8% (P<0.001), respectively. SF-36 physical functioning (P=0.03) and mental health (P<0.05) scores improved more in intervention compared with control participants, but role physical scores were significantly lower (P<0.01). There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes. More falls (P<0.001) and injuries (P=0.03) were recorded in the intervention group. Conclusions This programme of exercise on prescription increased physical activity and quality of life over two years, although falls and injuries also increased. This finding supports the use of exercise on prescription programmes as part of population strategies to reduce physical inactivity.

Mammalian menin protein is associated with chromatin modifying complexes and has been shown to bind a number of nuclear proteins, including the transcription factor JunD. Menin shows bidirectional effects acting positively on c-Jun and negatively on JunD. We have produced protein null alleles of Drosophila menin ( mnn1 ) and have over expressed the Mnn1 protein. Flies homozygous for protein-null mnn1 alleles are viable and fertile. Localized over-expression of Mnn1 causes defects in thoracic closure, a phenotype that sometimes results from insufficient Jun activity. We observed complex genetic interactions between mnn1 and jun in different developmental settings. Our data support the idea that one function of menin is to modulate Jun activity in a manner dependent on the cellular context.",pubmed,2025-05-17 11:22:22.304
PMC5473734,Evaluating the Clinical Validity of Gene-Disease Associations: An Evidence-Based Framework Developed by the Clinical Genome Resource,"With advances in genomic sequencing technology, the number of reported gene-disease relationships has rapidly expanded. However, the evidence supporting these claims varies widely, confounding accurate evaluation of genomic variation in a clinical setting. Despite the critical need to differentiate clinically valid relationships from less well-substantiated relationships, standard guidelines for such evaluation do not currently exist. The NIH-funded Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) has developed a framework to define and evaluate the clinical validity of gene-disease pairs across a variety of Mendelian disorders. In this manuscript we describe a proposed framework to evaluate relevant genetic and experimental evidence supporting or contradicting a gene-disease relationship and the subsequent validation of this framework using a set of representative gene-disease pairs. The framework provides a semiquantitative measurement for the strength of evidence of a gene-disease relationship that correlates to a qualitative classification: “Definitive,” “Strong,” “Moderate,” “Limited,” “No Reported Evidence,” or “Conflicting Evidence.” Within the ClinGen structure, classifications derived with this framework are reviewed and confirmed or adjusted based on clinical expertise of appropriate disease experts. Detailed guidance for utilizing this framework and access to the curation interface is available on our website. This evidence-based, systematic method to assess the strength of gene-disease relationships will facilitate more knowledgeable utilization of genomic variants in clinical and research settings.",pubmed,2025-05-17 11:42:52.653

PMC2760065 ,DIFFERENCES IN IMMUNE RESPONSE MAY EXPLAIN LOWER SURVIVAL AMONG OLDER MEN WITH PNEUMONIA,"Objective Lower life expectancy in men is generally attributed to higher likelihood of risky behavior and because men develop chronic conditions earlier. If sex-related differences in survival are independent of pre-infection chronic health and health behavior, it would suggest that survival differences may occur due to sex differences in quality of care and biologic response to infection and these differences may contribute to sex differences in life expectancy. We assessed if sex-related survival difference following community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is due to differences in clinical characteristics, quality of care, or immune response. Design, setting, and subjects Prospective observational cohort of 2183 subjects with CAP. Measurements and main results Mean age was 64.9 years. Compared to women, men were more likely to smoke and had more comorbidity. At emergency department presentation, men had different biomarker patterns, as evidenced by higher inflammation (tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10) and fibrinolysis (D-dimer), and lower coagulation biomarkers (antithrombin-III and Factor IX) (P<0.05). Small differences in favor of men were seen in care quality, including antibiotic timing and compliance with American Thoracic Society guidelines. Men had lower survival at 30, 90, 365 days. The higher one-year mortality was not attenuated when adjusted for differences in demographics, smoking, resuscitation, insurance, and vaccination status, comorbidity, hospital characteristics, and illness severity (unadjusted hazard ratio (HR)=1.35, p=0.003 and adjusted HR=1.29, p=0.004). HR were no longer statistically significant when additionally adjusted for differences in ED concentrations of TNF, IL-6, IL-10, D-dimer, antithrombin-III, and Factor IX (adjusted HR=1.27, p=0.17). Patterns of biomarkers observed in men were associated with worse survival over one year. Conclusions Lower survival among men following CAP was not explained by differences in chronic diseases, health behaviors, and quality of care. Patterns of inflammatory, coagulation, and fibrinolysis biomarkers among men may explain reduced short and long-term survival.",pubmed,2025-05-18 15:46:04.455

Design An exploratory cross‐sectional survey. Methods In 2018, 393 cancer nurses completed the 12 dimensions of the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture. Results The mean score for the overall patient safety grade was 61.3. The highest rated dimension was “teamwork within units” while “staffing” was the lowest in all four countries. Nurses in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom, scored higher on “communication openness”, the “frequency of events reported”, and “non‐punitive response to errors”, than nurses from Estonia or Germany. We found statistically significant differences between the countries for the association between five of the 12 dimensions with the overall patient safety grade: overall perception of patient safety, communication openness, staffing, handoffs and transitions and non‐punitive response to errors. Conclusion Patient safety culture, as reported by cancer nurses, varies between European countries and contextual factors, such as recognition of the nursing role and education have an impact on it. Cancer nurses’ role in promoting patient safety is a key concern and requires better recognition on a European and global level. Impact Cancer Nursing Societies in any country can use these data as an indication on how to improve patient care in their country.

PMC3234432 ,Biodiversity information platforms: From standards to interoperability,"Abstract One of the most serious bottlenecks in the scientific workflows of biodiversity sciences is the need to integrate data from different sources, software applications, and services for analysis, visualisation and publication. For more than a quarter of a century the TDWG Biodiversity Information Standards organisation has a central role in defining and promoting data standards and protocols supporting interoperability between disparate and locally distributed systems.Although often not sufficiently recognized, TDWG standards are the foundation of many popular Biodiversity Informatics applications and infrastructures ranging from small desktop software solutions to large scale international data networks. However, individual scientists and groups of collaborating scientist have difficulties in fully exploiting the potential of standards that are often notoriously complex, lack non-technical documentations, and use different representations and underlying technologies. In the last few years, a series of initiatives such as Scratchpads, the EDIT Platform for Cybertaxonomy, and biowikifarm have started to implement and set up virtual work platforms for biodiversity sciences which shield their users from the complexity of the underlying standards. Apart from being practical work-horses for numerous working processes related to biodiversity sciences, they can be seen as information brokers mediating information between multiple data standards and protocols.The ViBRANT project will further strengthen the flexibility and power of virtual biodiversity working platforms by building software interfaces between them, thus facilitating essential information flows needed for comprehensive data exchange, data indexing, web-publication, and versioning. This work will make an important contribution to the shaping of an international, interoperable, and user-oriented biodiversity information infrastructure.",pubmed,2025-05-18 15:46:16.962
PMC8826231 ,A Comprehensive Overview of the Parathyroid Tumor From the Past Two Decades: Machine Learning-Based Bibliometric Analysis,"Introduction Parathyroid tumor, in particular carcinoma, is fairly rare among neoplasms of the endocrine system, unlike its benign counterpart. However, there is no bibliometric analysis in the field of parathyroid tumors comprehensively summarizing and discussing a large number of publications by a machine learning-based method. Materials and Methods Parathyroid tumor-related publications in PubMed from January 2001 to December 2020 were searched using the MeSH term “parathyroid neoplasms”. Latent Dirichlet allocation was adopted to identify the research topics from the abstract of each publication using Python. Results A total of 3,301 parathyroid tumor-associated publications were identified from the past 20 years, and included in further analyses. Research articles and case reports occupied the most proportion of publications, while the number of clinical studies and clinical trials decreased, especially in recent years. Technetium Tc 99m sestamibi was most studied among the diagnosis-related MeSH terms, while parathyroidectomy was among the treatment-related MeSH terms. The Latent Dirichlet allocation analyses showed that the top topics were 99m Tc-MIBI imaging, parathyroidectomy, gene expression in the cluster of diagnosis research, treatment research, and basic research. Notably, scarce connections were shown between the basic research cluster and the other two clusters, indicating the requirements of translational study turning basic biological knowledge into clinical practice. Conclusion The annual scientific publications on parathyroid tumors have scarcely changed during the last two decades. 99m Tc-MIBI imaging, parathyroidectomy, and gene expression are the most concerned topics in parathyroid tumor research.",pubmed,2025-05-18 15:46:22.731

PMC6646854,Protein kinase C-iota-mediated glycolysis promotes non-small-cell lung cancer progression,"Purpose To determine whether protein kinase C-iota (PKC-iota) is associated with glucose metabolism in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and whether its regulatory effect on metabolic and biological changes observed in NSCLC can be mediated by glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Patients and methods Forty-five NSCLC patients underwent combined 18 F-fludeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG) positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) before surgery, and another eighty-one NSCLC patients were followed-up for 1–91 months after tumor resection. The rate of glucose metabolism in NSCLC was quantified by measuring the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) by 18 F-FDG PET/CT. PKC-iota and GLUT1 in NSCLC were detected by immunostaining. In vitro, PKC-iota was knocked down, whereas GLUT1 was silenced with or without PKC-iota overexpression to identify the role of PKC-iota in glycolysis. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used in the correlation analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess survival duration. Results There was a positive relationship between PKC-iota expression and SUVmax in NSCLC (r=0.649, P <0.001). PKC-iota expression also showed a positive relationship with GLUT1 in NSCLC tissues (r=0.686, P <0.001). Patients whose NSCLC tissues highly co-expressed PKC-iota and GLUT1 had worse prognosis compared with patients without high co-expression of PKC-iota and GLUT1. In vitro, PKC-iota silencing significantly decreased the expression of GLUT1 and inhibited glucose uptake and glycolysis; c-Myc silencing restrained PKC-iota-mediated GLUT1 elevation; GLUT1 knockdown remarkably suppressed PKC-iota-mediated glycolysis and cell growth. Conclusion In NSCLC, the rate of glucose metabolism was positively correlated with PKC-iota expression. PKC-iota increased glucose accumulation and glycolysis by upregulating c-Myc/GLUT1 signaling and is thus involved in tumor progression.",pubmed,2025-05-18 15:46:35.155
PMC545722 ,Substrate Requirements for Regulated Intramembrane Proteolysis of ,"During sporulation of Bacillus subtilis , pro-σ K is activated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) in response to a signal from the forespore. RIP of pro-σ K removes its prosequence (amino acids 1 to 20), releasing σ K from the outer forespore membrane into the mother cell cytoplasm, in a reaction catalyzed by SpoIVFB, a metalloprotease in the S2P family of intramembrane-cleaving proteases. The requirements for pro-σ K to serve as a substrate for RIP were investigated by producing C-terminally truncated pro-σ K fused at different points to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or hexahistidine in sporulating B. subtilis or in Escherichia coli engineered to coexpress SpoIVFB. Nearly half of pro-σ K (amino acids 1 to 117), including part of sigma factor region 2.4, was required for RIP of pro-σ K -GFP chimeras in sporulating B. subtilis . Likewise, pro-σ K -hexahistidine chimeras demonstrated that the N-terminal 117 amino acids of pro-σ K are sufficient for RIP, although the N-terminal 126 amino acids, which includes all of region 2.4, allowed much better accumulation of the chimeric protein in sporulating B. subtilis and more efficient processing by SpoIVFB in E. coli . In contrast to the requirements for RIP, a much smaller N-terminal segment (amino acids 1 to 27) was sufficient for membrane localization of a pro-σ K -GFP chimera. Addition or deletion of five amino acids near the N terminus allowed accurate processing of pro-σ K , ruling out a mechanism in which SpoIVFB measures the distance from the N terminus to the cleavage site. A charge reversal at position 13 (substituting glutamate for lysine) reduced accumulation of pro-σ K and prevented detectable RIP by SpoIVFB. These results elucidate substrate requirements for RIP of pro-σ K by SpoIVFB and may have implications for substrate recognition by other S2P family members.",pubmed,2025-05-18 23:09:01.270

The phylogenomic analyses recovered the Entrophosporales as sister to a clade formed by Diversisporales and Glomeraceae. The strongly conserved entrophosporoid morph of E. infrequens , provided with a newly designated epitype, was shown to represent a group of cryptic species with the potential to produce different glomoid morphs. Of the four potential new species, three enriched the Entrophosporales as new Entrophospora species, E. argentinensis, E. glacialis , and E. furrazolae , which originated from Argentina, Sweden, Oman, and Poland. The fourth fungus appeared to be a glomoid morph of the E. infrequens epitype. The physical association of the E. infrequens entrophosporoid and glomoid morphs was reported and illustrated here for the first time.

PMC7449464 ,Assessing the format and content of journal published and non-journal published rapid review reports: A comparative study,"Background As production of rapid reviews (RRs) increases in healthcare, knowing how to efficiently convey RR evidence to various end-users is important given they are often intended to directly inform decision-making. Little is known about how often RRs are produced in the published or unpublished domains, and what and how information is structured. Objectives To compare and contrast report format and content features of journal-published (JP) and non-journal published (NJP) RRs. Methods JP RRs were identified from key databases, and NJP RRs were identified from a grey literature search of 148 RR producing organizations and were sampled proportionate to cluster size by organization and product type to match the JP RR group. We extracted and formally compared ‘how’ (i.e., visual arrangement) and ‘what’ information was presented. Results We identified 103 RRs (52 JP and 51 NJP) from 2016. A higher percentage of certain features were observed in JP RRs compared to NJP RRs (e.g., reporting authors; use of a traditional journal article structure; section headers including abstract, methods, discussion, conclusions, acknowledgments, conflict of interests, and author contributions; and use of figures (e.g., Study Flow Diagram) in the main document). For NJP RRs, a higher percentage of features were observed (e.g., use non-traditional report structures; bannering of executive summary sections and appendices; use of typographic cues; and including outcome tables). NJP RRs were more than double in length versus JP RRs. Including key messages was uncommon in both groups. Conclusions This comparative study highlights differences between JP and NJP RRs. Both groups may benefit from better use of plain language, and more clear and concise design. Alternative innovative formats and end-user preferences for content and layout should be studied further with thought given to other considerations to ensure better packaging of RR results to facilitate uptake into policy and practice.

PMC6116792 ,Cannabis and the Health and Performance of the Elite Athlete,"Objective: Cannabis (marijuana) is undergoing extensive regulatory review in many global jurisdictions for medical and nonmedical access. Cannabis has potential impact on the health of athletes as well as on performance in both training and in competition. The aim of this general review is to identify and highlight the challenges in interpreting information with respect to elite athletic performance, and to point to important research areas that need to be addressed. Data Sources: A nonsystematic literature review was conducted using Medline and PubMed for articles related to cannabis/marijuana use and sports/athletic performance; abstracts were reviewed by lead author and key themes identified and explored. Main Results: Cannabis may be primarily inhaled or ingested orally for a range of medical and nonmedical reasons; evidence for efficacy is limited but promising for chronic pain management. Although evidence for serious harms from cannabis use on health of athletes is limited, one should be cognizant of the potential for abuse and mental health issues. Although the prevalence of cannabis use among elite athletes is not well-known, use is associated with certain high-risk sports. There is no evidence for cannabis use as a performance-enhancing drug. Conclusions: Medical and nonmedical cannabis use among athletes reflects changing societal and cultural norms and experiences. Although cannabis use is more prevalent in some athletes engaged in high-risk sports, there is no direct evidence of performance-enhancing effects in athletes.

Despite its complex and rapidly evolving regulatory status in the United States, projected retail sales of CBD products—hemp, cannabis and pharmaceutical—are as high as $1.9 billion by 2020. CBD products can currently be purchased online, over the counter, and at cannabis-specific dispensaries throughout most parts of the country, despite the fact that CBD is presently deemed a Schedule I controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and renounced as a dietary supplement ingredient by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These products are largely unregulated, and are being used predominantly to treat specific medical conditions. Recent FDA approval of Epidiolex (CBD) as a treatment for certain pediatric seizure disorders will prompt scheduling of CBD and likely alter FDA enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C), which to date has mostly been in the form of warning letters. Persuasive legal arguments contend that CBD's legal status is based on its source. According to these arguments, there are three legal sources. CBD-derived from: (1) parts of the Cannabis plant that do not meet the definition of cannabis in the Controlled Substances Act (CSA); (2) imported “non-psychoactive hemp”; and (3) “Industrial hemp” cultivated as part of a state pilot program per the 2014 Farm Act. Although CBD's lawful status with respect to the CSA appears to be expanding, its future regulatory status with respect to the FD&C Act is difficult to predict.",pubmed,2025-05-18 23:10:00.376
PMC6387667 ,Cannabinoids in cancer treatment: Therapeutic potential and legislation,"The plant Cannabis sativa L. has been used as an herbal remedy for centuries and is the most important source of phytocannabinoids. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) consists of receptors, endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids) and metabolizing enzymes, and plays an important role in different physiological and pathological processes. Phytocannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoids can interact with the components of ECS or other cellular pathways and thus affect the development/progression of diseases, including cancer. In cancer patients, cannabinoids have primarily been used as a part of palliative care to alleviate pain, relieve nausea and stimulate appetite. In addition, numerous cell culture and animal studies showed antitumor effects of cannabinoids in various cancer types. Here we reviewed the literature on anticancer effects of plant-derived and synthetic cannabinoids, to better understand their mechanisms of action and role in cancer treatment. We also reviewed the current legislative updates on the use of cannabinoids for medical and therapeutic purposes, primarily in the EU countries. In vitro and in vivo cancer models show that cannabinoids can effectively modulate tumor growth, however, the antitumor effects appear to be largely dependent on cancer type and drug dose/concentration. Understanding how cannabinoids are able to regulate essential cellular processes involved in tumorigenesis, such as progression through the cell cycle, cell proliferation and cell death, as well as the interactions between cannabinoids and the immune system, are crucial for improving existing and developing new therapeutic approaches for cancer patients. The national legislation of the EU Member States defines the legal boundaries of permissible use of cannabinoids for medical and therapeutic purposes, however, these legislative guidelines may not be aligned with the current scientific knowledge.",pubmed,2025-05-18 23:10:02.633
PMC6522945 ,The Relationship between Marijuana Use Prior to Sex and Sexual Function in Women,"Introduction Scientific research on the effects of marijuana on sexual functioning in women, including libido, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction, is limited. Aim To evaluate women’s perceptions of the effect of marijuana use before sexual activity. Methods A cross-sectional design, from March 2016–February 2017, within a single, academic, obstetrics and gynecology practice, was performed. Patients were given a questionnaire at their visit and asked to complete it anonymously and place it in a locked box after their visit. Main Outcome Measures The primary outcome was satisfaction in the sexual domains of drive, orgasm, lubrication, dyspareunia, and overall sexual experience. The secondary outcome was the effect of the frequency of marijuana use on satisfaction. Results Of the 373 participants, 34.0% (n = 127) reported having used marijuana before sexual activity. Most women reported increases in sex drive, improvement in orgasm, decrease in pain, but no change in lubrication. After adjusting for race, women who reported marijuana use before sexual activity had 2.13 higher odds of reporting satisfactory orgasms (adjusted odds ratio = 2.13; 95% CI = 1.05, 4.35) than women who reported no marijuana use. After adjusting for race and age, women with frequent marijuana use, regardless of use before sex or not, had 2.10 times higher odds of reporting satisfactory orgasms than those with infrequent marijuana use (adjusted odds ratio = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.01–4.44). Conclusion Marijuana appears to improve satisfaction with orgasm. A better understanding of the role of the endocannabinoid system in women is important, because there is a paucity of literature, and it could help lead to development of treatments for female sexual dysfunction.

PMC6685292 ,Emerging Class of Omega-3 Fatty Acid Endocannabinoids & Their Derivatives,"Cannabinoid receptor activation is involved in homeostatic regulation of the body. These receptors are activated by cannabinoids, that include the active constituents of Cannabis sativa as well as endocannabinoids (eCBs). The eCBs are endogenously synthesized from the omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The consumption of omega-3 fatty acids shifts the balance towards a higher proportion of omega-3 eCBs, whose physiological functions warrants further investigation. Herein, we review the discovery of omega-3 fatty acid derived eCBs that are generated from long chain omega-3 PUFAs - docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHA-EA or synaptamide), docosahexanoyl-glycerol (DHG), eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamide (EPA-EA), eicosapentanoylglycerol (EPG). Furthermore, we outline the lesser known omega-3 eCB-like molecules that arise from the conjugation of the omega-3 fatty acids with neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine - DHA-serotonin (DHA-5HT), EPA-serotonin (EPA-5HT), DHA-dopamine (DHA-DA) and EPA-dopamine (EPA-DA). Additionally, we describe the role of these omega-3 eCBs and their derivatives in different disease states such as pain, inflammation and cancer. Moreover, we detail the formation and potential physiological roles of the oxidative metabolites that arise from the metabolism of omega-3 eCBs by eicosanoid synthesizing enzymes - cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX) and cytochrome P450 epoxygenase (CYP450). In summary, we outline the novel findings regarding a growing class of signaling molecules, omega-3 eCBs, that can control the physiological and pathophysiological processes in the body.",pubmed,2025-05-18 23:10:08.349
PMC7120914 ,Therapeutic and Medicinal Uses of Terpenes,"Terpenes, also known as terpenoids are the largest and most diverse group of naturally occurring compounds. Based on the number of isoprene units they have, they are classified as mono, di, tri, tetra, and sesquiterpenes. They are mostly found in plants and form the major constituent of essential oils from plants. Among the natural products that provide medical benefits for an organism, terpenes play a major and variety of roles. The common plant sources of terpenes are tea , thyme, cannabis, Spanish sage, and citrus fruits (e.g., lemon, orange, mandarin). Terpenes have a wide range of medicinal uses among which antiplasmodial activity is notable as its mechanism of action is similar to the popular antimalarial drug in use—chloroquine. Monoterpenes specifically are widely studied for their antiviral property. With growing incidents of cancer and diabetes in modern world, terpenes also have the potential to serve as anticancer and antidiabetic reagents. Along with these properties, terpenes also allow for flexibility in route of administration and suppression of side effects. Certain terpenes were widely used in natural folk medicine. One such terpene is curcumin which holds anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, antiseptic, antiplasmodial, astringent, digestive, diuretic, and many other properties. Curcumin has also become a recent trend in healthy foods and open doors for several medical researches. This chapter summarizes the various terpenes, their sources, medicinal properties, mechanism of action, and the recent studies that are underway for designing terpenes as a lead molecule in the modern medicine.",pubmed,2025-05-18 23:10:11.139
PMC7338332 ,Cannabidiol and Sports Performance: a Narrative Review of Relevant Evidence and Recommendations for Future Research,"Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-intoxicating cannabinoid derived from Cannabis sativa . CBD initially drew scientific interest due to its anticonvulsant properties but increasing evidence of other therapeutic effects has attracted the attention of additional clinical and non-clinical populations, including athletes. Unlike the intoxicating cannabinoid, Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ 9 -THC), CBD is no longer prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency and appears to be safe and well-tolerated in humans. It has also become readily available in many countries with the introduction of over-the-counter “nutraceutical” products. The aim of this narrative review was to explore various physiological and psychological effects of CBD that may be relevant to the sport and/or exercise context and to identify key areas for future research. As direct studies of CBD and sports performance are is currently lacking, evidence for this narrative review was sourced from preclinical studies and a limited number of clinical trials in non-athlete populations. Preclinical studies have observed robust anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and analgesic effects of CBD in animal models. Preliminary preclinical evidence also suggests that CBD may protect against gastrointestinal damage associated with inflammation and promote healing of traumatic skeletal injuries. However, further research is required to confirm these observations. Early stage clinical studies suggest that CBD may be anxiolytic in “stress-inducing” situations and in individuals with anxiety disorders. While some case reports indicate that CBD improves sleep, robust evidence is currently lacking. Cognitive function and thermoregulation appear to be unaffected by CBD while effects on food intake, metabolic function, cardiovascular function, and infection require further study. CBD may exert a number of physiological, biochemical, and psychological effects with the potential to benefit athletes. However, well controlled, studies in athlete populations are required before definitive conclusions can be reached regarding the utility of CBD in supporting athletic performance.",pubmed,2025-05-18 23:10:14.469
PMC7471121 ,A Survey Exploring the Relationship Between Cannabis Use Characteristics and Sexual Function in Men,"Introduction Cannabis is the most commonly used drug in the United States; however, the effects of cannabis use on male sexual function are poorly understood. Aim To characterize the contemporary landscape of cannabis use and to assess the associations between male sexual function and the frequency of use, the primary method of consumption, or cannabis chemovar (tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabidiol) among current users. Methods We surveyed adults who visited a single cannabis dispensary for baseline demographic information, medical history, cannabis use habits, and sexual function as assessed by the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). An IIEF-5 < 21 was considered erectile dysfunction. Main Outcome Measures The main outcome measure of the study was male sexual function via the IIEF domain scores. Results A total of 325 men completed the survey with a mean age of 46.7 years. 71.1% of the men were Caucasian and 52.6% were married. 13 men (4%) were never users; 29 men (8.9%) used 1–2 times/week; 51 men (15.7%) used 3–5 times/week, and 232 men (71.4%) used 6+ times/week. The average IIEF-5 score was 22.3 with 19.4% of the men having erectile dysfunction. In univariate analysis, men using cannabis more frequently had a higher overall IIEF (65.36 vs 60.52, P = .001), erectile domain (27.32 vs 25.74, P = .03), orgasm domain (9.08 vs 8.12, P < .001), intercourse satisfaction domain (12.42 vs 11.31, P = .006), and overall satisfaction domain (8.11 vs 7.05, P = .002). In multivariable analysis, compared to men who used cannabis 0 times/week, those who used 6 times/week had an increased overall IIEF (69.08 vs 64.64, P -value adjusted = 0.02), intercourse satisfaction domain ( P -value adjusted = 0.04), and overall satisfaction domain ( P -value adjusted = 0.02). The primary method of consumption (eg, smoking, edibles, etc.) and cannabinoid composition (eg, cannabidiol vs tetrahydrocannabinol dominant) were not associated with sexual function. Conclusion We report an association between the increased frequency of cannabis use and increased male sexual function. However, while the increased frequency of use was statistically significant with regard to the IIEF scores, the clinical significance of this is likely low, and selection bias may limit the generalizability of these findings. The method of consumption and cannabis chemovar were not associated with sexual function. Bhambhvani HP, Kasman AM, Wilson-King G, et al.

PMC4059969 ,Intraoperative fluoroscopy improves surgical precision in conventional TKA,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to assess whether intraoperative fluoroscopy assists in the restoration of the coronal limb alignment target in conventional total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Methods One hundred and six patients undergoing conventional cemented TKA were randomly assigned to be operated on with or without intraoperative fluoroscopy. The image intensifier, together with customized manual instrumentation, was used for separately measuring the frontal alignment of the femoral and tibial resection surfaces. The surgeon adjusted the resection surfaces when a mechanical axis deviation error angle of ≥0.5° was observed on the fluoroscopic image. Coronal alignment was measured on standing long-leg digital radiographs. Results Patients operated with fluoroscopy assistance had (1) a lower risk of malalignment at the threshold of >3° (risk ratio, 0.7; 95 % CI, 0.13–1.2), (2) a mean fluoroscopic time of 3 s, and (3) a longer operative time (69 vs. 60 min, p < 0.001). The American Knee Society Score was not different between the two groups at 1-year follow-up. Conclusion This new surgical intervention appears to offer an effective means for improving the precision of TKA alignment in the coronal plane.

Typically, regression coefficients are displayed in tables. While this mode of presentation is information-dense, extensive tables can be cumbersome to read and difficult to interpret. Here, we introduce three novel visualizations for reporting regression results. Our methods allow researchers to arrange large numbers of regression models in a single plot. Using regression results from real-world as well as simulated data, we demonstrate the transformations which are necessary to produce the required data structure and how to subsequently plot the results. The proposed methods provide visually appealing ways to report regression results efficiently and intuitively. Potential applications range from visual screening in the model selection stage to formal reporting in research papers. The procedure is fully reproducible using the provided code and can be executed via free-of-charge, open-source software routines in R.",pubmed,2025-05-18 23:10:34.744

PMC9922542 ,"The Triple-S framework: ensuring scalable, sustainable, and serviceable practices in educational technology","Educational institutions are increasingly investing into digital delivery, acquiring new devices, and employing novel software and services. The rising costs associated with maintenance, in combination with increasing redundancy of older technologies, presents multiple challenges. While lesson content itself may not have changed, the educational landscape constantly evolves, where tertiary institutions are incorporating new modes of content delivery, hybrid-style learning, and interactive technologies. Investments into digital expansions must be taken with caution, particularly prior to the procurement of technology, with a need for the proposed interventions’ scalability, sustainability, and serviceability to be considered. This article presents the Triple-S framework for educators, administrators, and educational institutions, and outlines examples of its application within curricula. The paper synthesises research evidence to provide the foundation underlying the key principles of the Triple-S framework, presenting a useful model to use when evaluating digital interventions. Utilising the framework for decisions regarding the acquisition of educational technology, devices, software, applications, and online resources can assist in the assurance of viable and  appropriate investments.

PMC8648051 ,"Two graphs walk into a bar: Readout-based measurement reveals the Bar-Tip Limit error, a common, categorical misinterpretation of mean bar graphs","How do viewers interpret graphs that abstract away from individual-level data to present only summaries of data such as means, intervals, distribution shapes, or effect sizes? Here, focusing on the mean bar graph as a prototypical example of such an abstracted presentation, we contribute three advances to the study of graph interpretation. First, we distill principles for Measurement of Abstract Graph Interpretation (MAGI principles) to guide the collection of valid interpretation data from viewers who may vary in expertise. Second, using these principles, we create the Draw Datapoints on Graphs (DDoG) measure, which collects drawn readouts (concrete, detailed, visuospatial records of thought) as a revealing window into each person's interpretation of a given graph. Third, using this new measure, we discover a common, categorical error in the interpretation of mean bar graphs: the Bar-Tip Limit (BTL) error. The BTL error is an apparent conflation of mean bar graphs with count bar graphs. It occurs when the raw data are assumed to be limited by the bar-tip, as in a count bar graph, rather than distributed across the bar-tip, as in a mean bar graph. In a large, demographically diverse sample, we observe the BTL error in about one in five persons; across educational levels, ages, and genders; and despite thoughtful responding and relevant foundational knowledge. The BTL error provides a case-in-point that simplification via abstraction in graph design can risk severe, high-prevalence misinterpretation. The ease with which our readout-based DDoG measure reveals the nature and likely cognitive mechanisms of the BTL error speaks to the value of both its readout-based approach and the MAGI principles that guided its creation. We conclude that mean bar graphs may be misinterpreted by a large portion of the population, and that enhanced measurement tools and strategies, like those introduced here, can fuel progress in the scientific study of graph interpretation.",pubmed,2025-05-18 23:11:00.072

PMC1234567,Intravenous contrast medium aggravates the impairment of pancreatic microcirculation in necrotizing pancreatitis in the rat.,"BACKGROUND: Previous reports demonstrated that radiographic contrast medium, as used in contrast-enhanced computed tomography, increases acinar necrosis and mortality in experimental pancreatitis. The authors studied the possibility that these changes may be related to an additional impairment of pancreatic microcirculation. METHODS: Fifty Wistar rats had acute pancreatitis induced by intraductal glycodeoxycholic acid (10 mmol/L for 10 min) and intravenous cerulein (5 micrograms/kg/hr for 6 hrs). After rehydration (16 mL/kg), pancreatic capillary perfusion was quantified by means of intravital microscopy at baseline before intravenous infusion of contrast medium (n = 25) or saline (n = 25), and 30 and 60 minutes thereafter. In addition to total capillary flow, capillaries were categorized as high- or low-flow (> or < 1.6 nL/min). RESULTS: Pancreatic capillary flow did not change in either high- or low-flow capillaries after saline infusion. However, contrast medium infusion induced a significant decrease of total capillary flow (p < 0.001). Analysis according to the relative flow rate revealed that this was primarily because of a significant additional reduction of perfusion in low-flow capillaries (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, complete capillary stasis was observed in 15.9 +/- 3.4% after contrast medium as compared with 3.2 +/- 1.2% after saline infusion (p < 0.006). CONCLUSION: Radiographic contrast medium aggravates the impairment of pancreatic microcirculation in experimental necrotizing pancreatitis.",pubmed,2025-05-19 17:24:47.592
PMC8765432,Identification of Novel Translated Small Open Reading Frames in ,"ABSTRACT Small proteins of <51 amino acids are abundant across all domains of life, but they are often overlooked because their small size makes them difficult to predict computationally and they are refractory to standard proteomic approaches. Ribosome profiling has been used to infer the existence of small proteins by detecting the translation of the corresponding open reading frames (ORFs). Detection of translated short ORFs by ribosome profiling can be improved by treating cells with drugs that stall ribosomes at specific codons. Here, we combine the analysis of ribosome profiling data for Escherichia coli cells treated with antibiotics that stall ribosomes at either the start or stop codons. Thus, we identify ribosome-occupied start and stop codons with high sensitivity for ∼400 novel putative ORFs. The newly discovered ORFs are mostly short, with 365 encoding proteins of <51 amino acids. We validate translation of several selected short ORFs and show that many likely encode unstable proteins. Moreover, we present evidence that most of the newly identified short ORFs are not under purifying selection, suggesting that they do not impact cell fitness, although a small subset have the hallmarks of functional ORFs. IMPORTANCE Small proteins of <51 amino acids are abundant across all domains of life, but they are often overlooked because their small size makes them difficult to predict computationally and they are refractory to standard proteomic approaches. Recent studies have discovered small proteins by mapping the location of translating ribosomes on RNA using a technique known as ribosome profiling. Discovery of translated sORFs using ribosome profiling can be improved by treating cells with drugs that trap initiating ribosomes. Here, we show that combining these data with equivalent data for cells treated with a drug that stalls terminating ribosomes facilitates the discovery of small proteins. We use this approach to discover 365 putative genes that encode small proteins in Escherichia coli .",pubmed,2025-05-19 17:25:07.704
