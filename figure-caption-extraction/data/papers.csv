PMC2876325,S-layer stabilized lipid membranes (Review),"The present review focuses on a unique bio-molecular construction kit based on surface-layer (S-layer) proteins as building blocks and patterning elements, but also major classes of biological molecules such as lipids, membrane-active peptides and membrane proteins, and glycans for the design of functional supported lipid membranes. The biomimetic approach copying the supramolecular building principle of most archaeal cell envelopes merely composed of a plasma membrane and a closely associated S-layer lattice has resulted in robust and fluid lipid membranes. Most importantly, S-layer supported lipid membranes spanning an aperture or generated on solid and porous substrates constitute highly interesting model membranes for the reconstitution of responsive transmembrane proteins and membrane-active peptides. This is of particular challenge as one-third of all proteins are membrane proteins such as pore-forming proteins, ion channels, and receptors. S-layer supported lipid membranes are seen as one of the most innovative strategies in membrane protein-based nanobiotechnology with potential applications that range from pharmaceutical (high-throughput) drug screening over lipid chips to the detection of biological warfare agents.",pubmed,2025-05-17 11:13:40.545
PMC1852221,Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression and outcome in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"We compared the gene expression profile of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to normal hematopoietic and non-ALL samples using oligonucleotide arrays. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was the highest overexpressed gene in B-cell ALL compared with the other groups, and displayed heterogeneous expression, suggesting it might have prognostic relevance. CTGF expression was examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) on 79 adult ALL specimens. CTGF expression levels were significantly increased in ALL cases with B-lineage ( P < .001), unfavorable cytogenetics ( P < .001), and blasts expressing CD34 ( P < .001). In a multivariate proportional hazards model, higher CTGF expression levels corresponded to worsening of overall survival (OS; hazard ratio 1.36, for each 10-fold increase in expression; P = .019). Further studies are ongoing to confirm the prognostic value of CTGF expression in ALL and to investigate its role in normal and abnormal lymphocyte biology.",pubmed,2025-05-17 11:22:00.604
PMC7080052,Diagnosis of severe respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients,"An increasing number of critically ill patients are immunocompromised. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (ARF), chiefly due to pulmonary infection, is the leading reason for ICU admission. Identifying the cause of ARF increases the chances of survival, but may be extremely challenging, as the underlying disease, treatments, and infection combine to create complex clinical pictures. In addition, there may be more than one infectious agent, and the pulmonary manifestations may be related to both infectious and non-infectious insults. Clinically or microbiologically documented bacterial pneumonia accounts for one-third of cases of ARF in immunocompromised patients. Early antibiotic therapy is recommended but decreases the chances of identifying the causative organism(s) to about 50%. Viruses are the second most common cause of severe respiratory infections. Positive tests for a virus in respiratory samples do not necessarily indicate a role for the virus in the current acute illness. Invasive fungal infections ( Aspergillus , Mucorales , and Pneumocystis jirovecii ) account for about 15% of severe respiratory infections, whereas parasites rarely cause severe acute infections in immunocompromised patients. This review focuses on the diagnosis of severe respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients. Special attention is given to newly validated diagnostic tests designed to be used on non-invasive samples or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and capable of increasing the likelihood of an early etiological diagnosis.

Findings This analytic modeling study of a hypothetical cohort of 4990 college-age students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 students with undetected asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection suggested that frequent screening (every 2 days) of all students with a low-sensitivity, high-specificity test might be required to control outbreaks with manageable isolation dormitory utilization at a justifiable cost. Meaning In this modeling study, symptom-based screening alone was not sufficient to contain an outbreak, and the safe reopening of campuses in fall 2020 may require screening every 2 days, uncompromising vigilance, and continuous attention to good prevention practices.",pubmed,2025-05-17 11:22:05.545
PMC7003694,Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Romanian International Knee Documentation Committee—subjective knee form,"Aim We aimed to translate and cross-culturally adapt the International Knee Documentation Committee—subjective knee form (IKDC) in Romanian. Method The original (US) IKDC—subjective knee form was translated according to recommended guidelines. Validity was tested using Spearmans’s correlation coefficient between score sand test-retest reproducibility. Reliability and internal consistency were determined using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results A total of 106 data sets were available for processing. The average age was 52 years and the male to female ratio was 40:66. Fifty-five subjects repeated the form after an average of 4 days. There were no floor or ceiling effects (range 3.4–74.7). There was a strong correlation between the first and repeated administration of the IKDC—subjective knee form ( r = 0.816, n = 50) and moderate compared to Tegner-Lysholm knee rating scale ( r = 0.506, n = 102), KOOSJR (Knee disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement, r =  − 0.622, n = 96), EuroqolEQ-5D-5L Index ( r = 0.633, n = 100) and visual analogue scale VAS ( r = 0.484, n = 99). Internal consistency was moderate with Cronbach’s alpha 0.611 ( n = 102) and ICC 0.611 for average measures (95% CI 0.493–0.713). Conclusion The Romanian translation of the IKDC—subjective knee form is a valid, consistent and reproducible outcome measure in patients with knee pain and dysfunction.",pubmed,2025-05-17 11:22:07.900

In this review, we first describe the methodologic advances made in gene expression analysis, from quantitative polymerase chain reaction to next-generation sequencing. We then discuss issues in gene expression experiments specific to MD, ranging from the choice of target tissues to the characterization of the case group. We provide a synopsis of the gene expression studies published thus far for MD, with a focus on studies using mRNA microarray methods.

PMC2769033,Exercise on prescription for women aged 40-74 recruited through primary care: two year randomised controlled trial,"Objective To assess the effectiveness of a primary care based programme of exercise on prescription among relatively inactive women over a two year period. Design Randomised controlled trial. Setting 17 primary care practices in Wellington, New Zealand Participants 1089 women aged 40-74 not undertaking 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on at least five days of the week Intervention Brief physical activity intervention led by nurse with six month follow-up visit and monthly telephone support over nine months. Main outcome measure Physical activity assessed at baseline and 12 and 24 months. Secondary outcomes were quality of life (SF-36), weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, concentrations of fasting serum lipids, glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ), glucose, insulin, and physical fitness. Results Mean age was 58.9 (SD 7) years. Trial retention rates were 93% and 89% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. At baseline, 10% of intervention participants and 11% of control participants were achieving 150 minutes of at least moderate intensity physical activity a week. At 12 months rates increased to 43% and 30% and at 24 months to 39.3% and 32.8% (P<0.001), respectively. SF-36 physical functioning (P=0.03) and mental health (P<0.05) scores improved more in intervention compared with control participants, but role physical scores were significantly lower (P<0.01). There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes. More falls (P<0.001) and injuries (P=0.03) were recorded in the intervention group. Conclusions This programme of exercise on prescription increased physical activity and quality of life over two years, although falls and injuries also increased. This finding supports the use of exercise on prescription programmes as part of population strategies to reduce physical inactivity.

PMC2291284,Genetic interactions between ,"Menin is a tumor suppressor required to prevent multiple endocrine neoplasia in humans. Mammalian menin protein is associated with chromatin modifying complexes and has been shown to bind a number of nuclear proteins, including the transcription factor JunD. Menin shows bidirectional effects acting positively on c-Jun and negatively on JunD. We have produced protein null alleles of Drosophila menin ( mnn1 ) and have over expressed the Mnn1 protein. Flies homozygous for protein-null mnn1 alleles are viable and fertile. Localized over-expression of Mnn1 causes defects in thoracic closure, a phenotype that sometimes results from insufficient Jun activity. We observed complex genetic interactions between mnn1 and jun in different developmental settings. Our data support the idea that one function of menin is to modulate Jun activity in a manner dependent on the cellular context.",pubmed,2025-05-17 11:22:22.304
PMC5473734,Evaluating the Clinical Validity of Gene-Disease Associations: An Evidence-Based Framework Developed by the Clinical Genome Resource,"With advances in genomic sequencing technology, the number of reported gene-disease relationships has rapidly expanded. However, the evidence supporting these claims varies widely, confounding accurate evaluation of genomic variation in a clinical setting. Despite the critical need to differentiate clinically valid relationships from less well-substantiated relationships, standard guidelines for such evaluation do not currently exist. The NIH-funded Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) has developed a framework to define and evaluate the clinical validity of gene-disease pairs across a variety of Mendelian disorders. In this manuscript we describe a proposed framework to evaluate relevant genetic and experimental evidence supporting or contradicting a gene-disease relationship and the subsequent validation of this framework using a set of representative gene-disease pairs. The framework provides a semiquantitative measurement for the strength of evidence of a gene-disease relationship that correlates to a qualitative classification: “Definitive,” “Strong,” “Moderate,” “Limited,” “No Reported Evidence,” or “Conflicting Evidence.” Within the ClinGen structure, classifications derived with this framework are reviewed and confirmed or adjusted based on clinical expertise of appropriate disease experts. Detailed guidance for utilizing this framework and access to the curation interface is available on our website. This evidence-based, systematic method to assess the strength of gene-disease relationships will facilitate more knowledgeable utilization of genomic variants in clinical and research settings.",pubmed,2025-05-17 11:42:52.653

PMC2760065 ,DIFFERENCES IN IMMUNE RESPONSE MAY EXPLAIN LOWER SURVIVAL AMONG OLDER MEN WITH PNEUMONIA,"Objective Lower life expectancy in men is generally attributed to higher likelihood of risky behavior and because men develop chronic conditions earlier. If sex-related differences in survival are independent of pre-infection chronic health and health behavior, it would suggest that survival differences may occur due to sex differences in quality of care and biologic response to infection and these differences may contribute to sex differences in life expectancy. We assessed if sex-related survival difference following community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is due to differences in clinical characteristics, quality of care, or immune response. Design, setting, and subjects Prospective observational cohort of 2183 subjects with CAP. Measurements and main results Mean age was 64.9 years. Compared to women, men were more likely to smoke and had more comorbidity. At emergency department presentation, men had different biomarker patterns, as evidenced by higher inflammation (tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10) and fibrinolysis (D-dimer), and lower coagulation biomarkers (antithrombin-III and Factor IX) (P<0.05). Small differences in favor of men were seen in care quality, including antibiotic timing and compliance with American Thoracic Society guidelines. Men had lower survival at 30, 90, 365 days. The higher one-year mortality was not attenuated when adjusted for differences in demographics, smoking, resuscitation, insurance, and vaccination status, comorbidity, hospital characteristics, and illness severity (unadjusted hazard ratio (HR)=1.35, p=0.003 and adjusted HR=1.29, p=0.004). HR were no longer statistically significant when additionally adjusted for differences in ED concentrations of TNF, IL-6, IL-10, D-dimer, antithrombin-III, and Factor IX (adjusted HR=1.27, p=0.17). Patterns of biomarkers observed in men were associated with worse survival over one year. Conclusions Lower survival among men following CAP was not explained by differences in chronic diseases, health behaviors, and quality of care. Patterns of inflammatory, coagulation, and fibrinolysis biomarkers among men may explain reduced short and long-term survival.",pubmed,2025-05-18 15:46:04.455

PMC6899826 ,"Patient safety culture among European cancer nurses—An exploratory, cross‐sectional survey comparing data from Estonia, Germany, Netherlands, and United Kingdom","Abstract Aim To explore the differences in perceived patient safety culture in cancer nurses working in Estonia, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Design An exploratory cross‐sectional survey. Methods In 2018, 393 cancer nurses completed the 12 dimensions of the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture. Results The mean score for the overall patient safety grade was 61.3. The highest rated dimension was “teamwork within units” while “staffing” was the lowest in all four countries. Nurses in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom, scored higher on “communication openness”, the “frequency of events reported”, and “non‐punitive response to errors”, than nurses from Estonia or Germany. We found statistically significant differences between the countries for the association between five of the 12 dimensions with the overall patient safety grade: overall perception of patient safety, communication openness, staffing, handoffs and transitions and non‐punitive response to errors. Conclusion Patient safety culture, as reported by cancer nurses, varies between European countries and contextual factors, such as recognition of the nursing role and education have an impact on it. Cancer nurses’ role in promoting patient safety is a key concern and requires better recognition on a European and global level. Impact Cancer Nursing Societies in any country can use these data as an indication on how to improve patient care in their country. Recognition of cancer nursing as a distinct specialty in nursing will help to improve patient safety.",pubmed,2025-05-18 15:46:10.231

PMC3234432 ,Biodiversity information platforms: From standards to interoperability,"Abstract One of the most serious bottlenecks in the scientific workflows of biodiversity sciences is the need to integrate data from different sources, software applications, and services for analysis, visualisation and publication. For more than a quarter of a century the TDWG Biodiversity Information Standards organisation has a central role in defining and promoting data standards and protocols supporting interoperability between disparate and locally distributed systems.Although often not sufficiently recognized, TDWG standards are the foundation of many popular Biodiversity Informatics applications and infrastructures ranging from small desktop software solutions to large scale international data networks. However, individual scientists and groups of collaborating scientist have difficulties in fully exploiting the potential of standards that are often notoriously complex, lack non-technical documentations, and use different representations and underlying technologies. In the last few years, a series of initiatives such as Scratchpads, the EDIT Platform for Cybertaxonomy, and biowikifarm have started to implement and set up virtual work platforms for biodiversity sciences which shield their users from the complexity of the underlying standards. Apart from being practical work-horses for numerous working processes related to biodiversity sciences, they can be seen as information brokers mediating information between multiple data standards and protocols.The ViBRANT project will further strengthen the flexibility and power of virtual biodiversity working platforms by building software interfaces between them, thus facilitating essential information flows needed for comprehensive data exchange, data indexing, web-publication, and versioning. This work will make an important contribution to the shaping of an international, interoperable, and user-oriented biodiversity information infrastructure.",pubmed,2025-05-18 15:46:16.962
PMC8826231 ,A Comprehensive Overview of the Parathyroid Tumor From the Past Two Decades: Machine Learning-Based Bibliometric Analysis,"Introduction Parathyroid tumor, in particular carcinoma, is fairly rare among neoplasms of the endocrine system, unlike its benign counterpart. However, there is no bibliometric analysis in the field of parathyroid tumors comprehensively summarizing and discussing a large number of publications by a machine learning-based method. Materials and Methods Parathyroid tumor-related publications in PubMed from January 2001 to December 2020 were searched using the MeSH term “parathyroid neoplasms”. Latent Dirichlet allocation was adopted to identify the research topics from the abstract of each publication using Python. Results A total of 3,301 parathyroid tumor-associated publications were identified from the past 20 years, and included in further analyses. Research articles and case reports occupied the most proportion of publications, while the number of clinical studies and clinical trials decreased, especially in recent years. Technetium Tc 99m sestamibi was most studied among the diagnosis-related MeSH terms, while parathyroidectomy was among the treatment-related MeSH terms. The Latent Dirichlet allocation analyses showed that the top topics were 99m Tc-MIBI imaging, parathyroidectomy, gene expression in the cluster of diagnosis research, treatment research, and basic research. Notably, scarce connections were shown between the basic research cluster and the other two clusters, indicating the requirements of translational study turning basic biological knowledge into clinical practice. Conclusion The annual scientific publications on parathyroid tumors have scarcely changed during the last two decades. 99m Tc-MIBI imaging, parathyroidectomy, and gene expression are the most concerned topics in parathyroid tumor research.",pubmed,2025-05-18 15:46:22.731

The empyema results in a complex medical challenge that requires combination of medical therapies, mechanical ventilation and surgery. The chest drainage approach was not successful to relieve the symptomatology and to drain the excess fluid. After multidisciplinary discussion, a surgical approach was recommended. Even though decortication and pleurectomy are high-risk procedures, they must be considered as an option for pleural effusion in Coronavirus disease-positive patients. This is a life-treating condition, which can worsen the coronavirus disease manifestation and should be treated immediately to improve patient’s status and chance of recovery.",pubmed,2025-05-18 15:46:26.582

PMC6646854,Protein kinase C-iota-mediated glycolysis promotes non-small-cell lung cancer progression,"Purpose To determine whether protein kinase C-iota (PKC-iota) is associated with glucose metabolism in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and whether its regulatory effect on metabolic and biological changes observed in NSCLC can be mediated by glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Patients and methods Forty-five NSCLC patients underwent combined 18 F-fludeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG) positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) before surgery, and another eighty-one NSCLC patients were followed-up for 1–91 months after tumor resection. The rate of glucose metabolism in NSCLC was quantified by measuring the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) by 18 F-FDG PET/CT. PKC-iota and GLUT1 in NSCLC were detected by immunostaining. In vitro, PKC-iota was knocked down, whereas GLUT1 was silenced with or without PKC-iota overexpression to identify the role of PKC-iota in glycolysis. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used in the correlation analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess survival duration. Results There was a positive relationship between PKC-iota expression and SUVmax in NSCLC (r=0.649, P <0.001). PKC-iota expression also showed a positive relationship with GLUT1 in NSCLC tissues (r=0.686, P <0.001). Patients whose NSCLC tissues highly co-expressed PKC-iota and GLUT1 had worse prognosis compared with patients without high co-expression of PKC-iota and GLUT1. In vitro, PKC-iota silencing significantly decreased the expression of GLUT1 and inhibited glucose uptake and glycolysis; c-Myc silencing restrained PKC-iota-mediated GLUT1 elevation; GLUT1 knockdown remarkably suppressed PKC-iota-mediated glycolysis and cell growth. Conclusion In NSCLC, the rate of glucose metabolism was positively correlated with PKC-iota expression. PKC-iota increased glucose accumulation and glycolysis by upregulating c-Myc/GLUT1 signaling and is thus involved in tumor progression.",pubmed,2025-05-18 15:46:35.155
