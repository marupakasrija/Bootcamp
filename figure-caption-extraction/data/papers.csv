PMC2876325,S-layer stabilized lipid membranes (Review),"The present review focuses on a unique bio-molecular construction kit based on surface-layer (S-layer) proteins as building blocks and patterning elements, but also major classes of biological molecules such as lipids, membrane-active peptides and membrane proteins, and glycans for the design of functional supported lipid membranes. The biomimetic approach copying the supramolecular building principle of most archaeal cell envelopes merely composed of a plasma membrane and a closely associated S-layer lattice has resulted in robust and fluid lipid membranes. Most importantly, S-layer supported lipid membranes spanning an aperture or generated on solid and porous substrates constitute highly interesting model membranes for the reconstitution of responsive transmembrane proteins and membrane-active peptides. This is of particular challenge as one-third of all proteins are membrane proteins such as pore-forming proteins, ion channels, and receptors. S-layer supported lipid membranes are seen as one of the most innovative strategies in membrane protein-based nanobiotechnology with potential applications that range from pharmaceutical (high-throughput) drug screening over lipid chips to the detection of biological warfare agents.",pubmed,2025-05-17 11:13:40.545
PMC1852221,Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression and outcome in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"We compared the gene expression profile of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to normal hematopoietic and non-ALL samples using oligonucleotide arrays. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was the highest overexpressed gene in B-cell ALL compared with the other groups, and displayed heterogeneous expression, suggesting it might have prognostic relevance. CTGF expression was examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) on 79 adult ALL specimens. CTGF expression levels were significantly increased in ALL cases with B-lineage ( P < .001), unfavorable cytogenetics ( P < .001), and blasts expressing CD34 ( P < .001). In a multivariate proportional hazards model, higher CTGF expression levels corresponded to worsening of overall survival (OS; hazard ratio 1.36, for each 10-fold increase in expression; P = .019). Further studies are ongoing to confirm the prognostic value of CTGF expression in ALL and to investigate its role in normal and abnormal lymphocyte biology.",pubmed,2025-05-17 11:22:00.604
PMC7080052,Diagnosis of severe respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients,"An increasing number of critically ill patients are immunocompromised. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (ARF), chiefly due to pulmonary infection, is the leading reason for ICU admission. Identifying the cause of ARF increases the chances of survival, but may be extremely challenging, as the underlying disease, treatments, and infection combine to create complex clinical pictures. In addition, there may be more than one infectious agent, and the pulmonary manifestations may be related to both infectious and non-infectious insults. Clinically or microbiologically documented bacterial pneumonia accounts for one-third of cases of ARF in immunocompromised patients. Early antibiotic therapy is recommended but decreases the chances of identifying the causative organism(s) to about 50%. Viruses are the second most common cause of severe respiratory infections. Positive tests for a virus in respiratory samples do not necessarily indicate a role for the virus in the current acute illness. Invasive fungal infections ( Aspergillus , Mucorales , and Pneumocystis jirovecii ) account for about 15% of severe respiratory infections, whereas parasites rarely cause severe acute infections in immunocompromised patients. This review focuses on the diagnosis of severe respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients. Special attention is given to newly validated diagnostic tests designed to be used on non-invasive samples or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and capable of increasing the likelihood of an early etiological diagnosis.

Findings This analytic modeling study of a hypothetical cohort of 4990 college-age students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 students with undetected asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection suggested that frequent screening (every 2 days) of all students with a low-sensitivity, high-specificity test might be required to control outbreaks with manageable isolation dormitory utilization at a justifiable cost. Meaning In this modeling study, symptom-based screening alone was not sufficient to contain an outbreak, and the safe reopening of campuses in fall 2020 may require screening every 2 days, uncompromising vigilance, and continuous attention to good prevention practices.",pubmed,2025-05-17 11:22:05.545
PMC7003694,Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Romanian International Knee Documentation Committee—subjective knee form,"Aim We aimed to translate and cross-culturally adapt the International Knee Documentation Committee—subjective knee form (IKDC) in Romanian. Method The original (US) IKDC—subjective knee form was translated according to recommended guidelines. Validity was tested using Spearmans’s correlation coefficient between score sand test-retest reproducibility. Reliability and internal consistency were determined using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results A total of 106 data sets were available for processing. The average age was 52 years and the male to female ratio was 40:66. Fifty-five subjects repeated the form after an average of 4 days. There were no floor or ceiling effects (range 3.4–74.7). There was a strong correlation between the first and repeated administration of the IKDC—subjective knee form ( r = 0.816, n = 50) and moderate compared to Tegner-Lysholm knee rating scale ( r = 0.506, n = 102), KOOSJR (Knee disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement, r =  − 0.622, n = 96), EuroqolEQ-5D-5L Index ( r = 0.633, n = 100) and visual analogue scale VAS ( r = 0.484, n = 99). Internal consistency was moderate with Cronbach’s alpha 0.611 ( n = 102) and ICC 0.611 for average measures (95% CI 0.493–0.713). Conclusion The Romanian translation of the IKDC—subjective knee form is a valid, consistent and reproducible outcome measure in patients with knee pain and dysfunction.",pubmed,2025-05-17 11:22:07.900

PMC2769033,Exercise on prescription for women aged 40-74 recruited through primary care: two year randomised controlled trial,"Objective To assess the effectiveness of a primary care based programme of exercise on prescription among relatively inactive women over a two year period. Design Randomised controlled trial. Setting 17 primary care practices in Wellington, New Zealand Participants 1089 women aged 40-74 not undertaking 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on at least five days of the week Intervention Brief physical activity intervention led by nurse with six month follow-up visit and monthly telephone support over nine months. Main outcome measure Physical activity assessed at baseline and 12 and 24 months. Secondary outcomes were quality of life (SF-36), weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, concentrations of fasting serum lipids, glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ), glucose, insulin, and physical fitness. Results Mean age was 58.9 (SD 7) years. Trial retention rates were 93% and 89% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. At baseline, 10% of intervention participants and 11% of control participants were achieving 150 minutes of at least moderate intensity physical activity a week. At 12 months rates increased to 43% and 30% and at 24 months to 39.3% and 32.8% (P<0.001), respectively. SF-36 physical functioning (P=0.03) and mental health (P<0.05) scores improved more in intervention compared with control participants, but role physical scores were significantly lower (P<0.01). There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes. More falls (P<0.001) and injuries (P=0.03) were recorded in the intervention group. Conclusions This programme of exercise on prescription increased physical activity and quality of life over two years, although falls and injuries also increased. This finding supports the use of exercise on prescription programmes as part of population strategies to reduce physical inactivity.

PMC2291284,Genetic interactions between ,"Menin is a tumor suppressor required to prevent multiple endocrine neoplasia in humans. Mammalian menin protein is associated with chromatin modifying complexes and has been shown to bind a number of nuclear proteins, including the transcription factor JunD. Menin shows bidirectional effects acting positively on c-Jun and negatively on JunD. We have produced protein null alleles of Drosophila menin ( mnn1 ) and have over expressed the Mnn1 protein. Flies homozygous for protein-null mnn1 alleles are viable and fertile. Localized over-expression of Mnn1 causes defects in thoracic closure, a phenotype that sometimes results from insufficient Jun activity. We observed complex genetic interactions between mnn1 and jun in different developmental settings. Our data support the idea that one function of menin is to modulate Jun activity in a manner dependent on the cellular context.",pubmed,2025-05-17 11:22:22.304
PMC5473734,Evaluating the Clinical Validity of Gene-Disease Associations: An Evidence-Based Framework Developed by the Clinical Genome Resource,"With advances in genomic sequencing technology, the number of reported gene-disease relationships has rapidly expanded. However, the evidence supporting these claims varies widely, confounding accurate evaluation of genomic variation in a clinical setting. Despite the critical need to differentiate clinically valid relationships from less well-substantiated relationships, standard guidelines for such evaluation do not currently exist. The NIH-funded Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) has developed a framework to define and evaluate the clinical validity of gene-disease pairs across a variety of Mendelian disorders. In this manuscript we describe a proposed framework to evaluate relevant genetic and experimental evidence supporting or contradicting a gene-disease relationship and the subsequent validation of this framework using a set of representative gene-disease pairs. The framework provides a semiquantitative measurement for the strength of evidence of a gene-disease relationship that correlates to a qualitative classification: “Definitive,” “Strong,” “Moderate,” “Limited,” “No Reported Evidence,” or “Conflicting Evidence.” Within the ClinGen structure, classifications derived with this framework are reviewed and confirmed or adjusted based on clinical expertise of appropriate disease experts. Detailed guidance for utilizing this framework and access to the curation interface is available on our website. This evidence-based, systematic method to assess the strength of gene-disease relationships will facilitate more knowledgeable utilization of genomic variants in clinical and research settings.",pubmed,2025-05-17 11:42:52.653

PMC2760065 ,DIFFERENCES IN IMMUNE RESPONSE MAY EXPLAIN LOWER SURVIVAL AMONG OLDER MEN WITH PNEUMONIA,"Objective Lower life expectancy in men is generally attributed to higher likelihood of risky behavior and because men develop chronic conditions earlier. If sex-related differences in survival are independent of pre-infection chronic health and health behavior, it would suggest that survival differences may occur due to sex differences in quality of care and biologic response to infection and these differences may contribute to sex differences in life expectancy. We assessed if sex-related survival difference following community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is due to differences in clinical characteristics, quality of care, or immune response. Design, setting, and subjects Prospective observational cohort of 2183 subjects with CAP. Measurements and main results Mean age was 64.9 years. Compared to women, men were more likely to smoke and had more comorbidity. At emergency department presentation, men had different biomarker patterns, as evidenced by higher inflammation (tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10) and fibrinolysis (D-dimer), and lower coagulation biomarkers (antithrombin-III and Factor IX) (P<0.05). Small differences in favor of men were seen in care quality, including antibiotic timing and compliance with American Thoracic Society guidelines. Men had lower survival at 30, 90, 365 days. The higher one-year mortality was not attenuated when adjusted for differences in demographics, smoking, resuscitation, insurance, and vaccination status, comorbidity, hospital characteristics, and illness severity (unadjusted hazard ratio (HR)=1.35, p=0.003 and adjusted HR=1.29, p=0.004). HR were no longer statistically significant when additionally adjusted for differences in ED concentrations of TNF, IL-6, IL-10, D-dimer, antithrombin-III, and Factor IX (adjusted HR=1.27, p=0.17). Patterns of biomarkers observed in men were associated with worse survival over one year. Conclusions Lower survival among men following CAP was not explained by differences in chronic diseases, health behaviors, and quality of care. Patterns of inflammatory, coagulation, and fibrinolysis biomarkers among men may explain reduced short and long-term survival.",pubmed,2025-05-18 15:46:04.455

PMC6899826 ,"Patient safety culture among European cancer nurses—An exploratory, cross‐sectional survey comparing data from Estonia, Germany, Netherlands, and United Kingdom","Abstract Aim To explore the differences in perceived patient safety culture in cancer nurses working in Estonia, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Design An exploratory cross‐sectional survey. Methods In 2018, 393 cancer nurses completed the 12 dimensions of the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture. Results The mean score for the overall patient safety grade was 61.3. The highest rated dimension was “teamwork within units” while “staffing” was the lowest in all four countries. Nurses in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom, scored higher on “communication openness”, the “frequency of events reported”, and “non‐punitive response to errors”, than nurses from Estonia or Germany. We found statistically significant differences between the countries for the association between five of the 12 dimensions with the overall patient safety grade: overall perception of patient safety, communication openness, staffing, handoffs and transitions and non‐punitive response to errors. Conclusion Patient safety culture, as reported by cancer nurses, varies between European countries and contextual factors, such as recognition of the nursing role and education have an impact on it. Cancer nurses’ role in promoting patient safety is a key concern and requires better recognition on a European and global level. Impact Cancer Nursing Societies in any country can use these data as an indication on how to improve patient care in their country. Recognition of cancer nursing as a distinct specialty in nursing will help to improve patient safety.",pubmed,2025-05-18 15:46:10.231

PMC3234432 ,Biodiversity information platforms: From standards to interoperability,"Abstract One of the most serious bottlenecks in the scientific workflows of biodiversity sciences is the need to integrate data from different sources, software applications, and services for analysis, visualisation and publication. For more than a quarter of a century the TDWG Biodiversity Information Standards organisation has a central role in defining and promoting data standards and protocols supporting interoperability between disparate and locally distributed systems.Although often not sufficiently recognized, TDWG standards are the foundation of many popular Biodiversity Informatics applications and infrastructures ranging from small desktop software solutions to large scale international data networks. However, individual scientists and groups of collaborating scientist have difficulties in fully exploiting the potential of standards that are often notoriously complex, lack non-technical documentations, and use different representations and underlying technologies. In the last few years, a series of initiatives such as Scratchpads, the EDIT Platform for Cybertaxonomy, and biowikifarm have started to implement and set up virtual work platforms for biodiversity sciences which shield their users from the complexity of the underlying standards. Apart from being practical work-horses for numerous working processes related to biodiversity sciences, they can be seen as information brokers mediating information between multiple data standards and protocols.The ViBRANT project will further strengthen the flexibility and power of virtual biodiversity working platforms by building software interfaces between them, thus facilitating essential information flows needed for comprehensive data exchange, data indexing, web-publication, and versioning. This work will make an important contribution to the shaping of an international, interoperable, and user-oriented biodiversity information infrastructure.",pubmed,2025-05-18 15:46:16.962

However, there is no bibliometric analysis in the field of parathyroid tumors comprehensively summarizing and discussing a large number of publications by a machine learning-based method. Materials and Methods Parathyroid tumor-related publications in PubMed from January 2001 to December 2020 were searched using the MeSH term “parathyroid neoplasms”. Latent Dirichlet allocation was adopted to identify the research topics from the abstract of each publication using Python. Results A total of 3,301 parathyroid tumor-associated publications were identified from the past 20 years, and included in further analyses. Research articles and case reports occupied the most proportion of publications, while the number of clinical studies and clinical trials decreased, especially in recent years. Technetium Tc 99m sestamibi was most studied among the diagnosis-related MeSH terms, while parathyroidectomy was among the treatment-related MeSH terms. The Latent Dirichlet allocation analyses showed that the top topics were 99m Tc-MIBI imaging, parathyroidectomy, gene expression in the cluster of diagnosis research, treatment research, and basic research. Notably, scarce connections were shown between the basic research cluster and the other two clusters, indicating the requirements of translational study turning basic biological knowledge into clinical practice.

PMC6646854,Protein kinase C-iota-mediated glycolysis promotes non-small-cell lung cancer progression,"Purpose To determine whether protein kinase C-iota (PKC-iota) is associated with glucose metabolism in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and whether its regulatory effect on metabolic and biological changes observed in NSCLC can be mediated by glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Patients and methods Forty-five NSCLC patients underwent combined 18 F-fludeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG) positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) before surgery, and another eighty-one NSCLC patients were followed-up for 1–91 months after tumor resection. The rate of glucose metabolism in NSCLC was quantified by measuring the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) by 18 F-FDG PET/CT. PKC-iota and GLUT1 in NSCLC were detected by immunostaining. In vitro, PKC-iota was knocked down, whereas GLUT1 was silenced with or without PKC-iota overexpression to identify the role of PKC-iota in glycolysis. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used in the correlation analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess survival duration. Results There was a positive relationship between PKC-iota expression and SUVmax in NSCLC (r=0.649, P <0.001). PKC-iota expression also showed a positive relationship with GLUT1 in NSCLC tissues (r=0.686, P <0.001). Patients whose NSCLC tissues highly co-expressed PKC-iota and GLUT1 had worse prognosis compared with patients without high co-expression of PKC-iota and GLUT1. In vitro, PKC-iota silencing significantly decreased the expression of GLUT1 and inhibited glucose uptake and glycolysis; c-Myc silencing restrained PKC-iota-mediated GLUT1 elevation; GLUT1 knockdown remarkably suppressed PKC-iota-mediated glycolysis and cell growth. Conclusion In NSCLC, the rate of glucose metabolism was positively correlated with PKC-iota expression. PKC-iota increased glucose accumulation and glycolysis by upregulating c-Myc/GLUT1 signaling and is thus involved in tumor progression.",pubmed,2025-05-18 15:46:35.155

Bioinformaticians working in these facilities provide computational biology support to medical doctors and principal investigators who are daily dealing with data of patients to analyze. These bioinformatics analysts, although pivotal, usually do not receive formal training for this job. We therefore propose these ten simple rules to guide these bioinformaticians in their work: ten pieces of advice on how to provide bioinformatics support to medical doctors in hospitals.

PMC8649057,Physician Interpretation of Data of Uncertain Clinical Utility in Oncology Prescription Drug Promotion,"Little is known about how physicians interpret data displays that depict preliminary or exploratory clinical data in physician‐targeted sales aids for oncology drugs. Using three factorial experiments, we examined whether disclosures of data limitations and clinical uncertainty adequately communicate the limitations and practical utility of this type of data. The studies used a 2 (disclosure of data limitations: technical, nontechnical) × 2 (disclosure of clinical uncertainty: present, absent) + 1 (control: no disclosure) between‐subjects experimental design to examine the impact of disclosures as they relate to presentations of preliminary or exploratory data in promotional communications for oncology products. In each experiment, we randomized oncologists and primary care physicians with oncology experience to view one version of a two‐page sales aid. Following this exposure, physicians completed a web‐based survey. The design was replicated in three concurrently conducted experiments using sales aids for different fictitious oncology drugs, each featuring one of three common data displays: a forest plot ( Results provide initial evidence that in some contexts disclosures can improve understanding of the clinical utility of certain information about a drug and the limitations of results presented in a data display. Disclosures can also temper perceptions of how much evidence is presented that supports a conclusion that the drug is an appropriate treatment. In terms of the language used in the disclosure of data limitations, physicians in all three experiments strongly preferred the nontechnical disclosures. The findings from the three experiments in this study suggest that disclosures have the potential to increase relevant knowledge, but more research is needed to establish best practice recommendations for using disclosures to convey contextual information relevant for interpreting data displays in promotional communications. This article reports the results from three large, online experimental studies that address a growing concern that drug companies often share favorable clinical trial results with physicians in promotional materials that lack important context for physicians to interpret the data. This series of studies investigates whether strategic use of two types of disclosures (disclosure of data limitations and a disclosure of clinical uncertainty) improves understanding and reduces misinterpretations among physicians. The results from these studies help identify communication factors that impact how physicians critically appraise preliminary or exploratory clinical trial data to inform policy and regulatory efforts.",pubmed,2025-05-20 20:08:20.582

PMC7003695,Identification of key genes associated with multiple sclerosis based on gene expression data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells,"The aim of this study was to identify the potential key candidate genes of multiple sclerosis (MS) and uncover mechanisms in MS. We combined data from the microarray expression profile of three MS stages and performed bioinformatics analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among the distinct stages of MS and healthy controls, and a total of 349 shared DEGs were identified. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses showed that the DEGs were significantly enriched in the biological processes (BPs) of purine-related metabolic processes and signaling, especially the common DEGs, which were enriched in some immunological processes. Most of the DEGs were enriched in signaling pathways associated with the immune system, some immune diseases and infectious disease pathways. Through a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and a gene expression regulatory network constructed with MS-related miRNAs, we confirmed FOS, TP53, VEGFA, JUN, HIF1A, RB1, PTGS2, CXCL8, OAS2, NFKBIA and OAS1 as candidate genes of MS. Furthermore , we explored the potential SNPs associated with MS by database mining. In conclusion, this study provides the identified genes, SNPs, biological processes, and cellular pathways associated with MS. The uncovered candidate genes may be potential biomarkers involved in the diagnosis and therapy of MS.",pubmed,2025-05-20 20:08:48.985
PMC10000041,The Role of Environmental Enrichment and Back Fat Depth in the Intensity of Aggressive Behavior Performed by Sows during the Establishment of the Dominance Hierarchy,"The need to establish a social hierarchy represents a period of severe stress for sows when they are introduced into new groups because of the associated aggressive behavior. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of providing access to straw in racks and manila ropes (IMPROVED) on aggressive behavior after mixing, compared to a typical minimal enrichment gestation system (CONTROL), and to understand the effect of parity order and backfat on the level of the aggression. The overall average number of fights and the initiated aggressive behavior in the three observation days were greater in the CONTROL pens, although within time, we found a significant effect of treatment only on the number of fights performed 3 weeks post-mixing. The effect of backfat thickness revealed an effect only on the observations of initiated aggressive behavior, which was most frequently performed by sow with a low backfat thickness. Parity order did not have a significant effect on the display of any of the aggressive behaviors. These results suggest that aggression at mixing is unavoidable and, indeed, is essential to ensuring the establishment of the dominance hierarchy and thereby achieving group stability. Nevertheless, optimal enrichment materials could have a beneficial effect on at least reducing its frequency. For sows introduced into new groups, the aggressive behavior associated with establishing a social hierarchy represents a period of severe stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of providing sows with an improved pen environment (straw in racks and ropes) on aggressive behavior after mixing and to understand the role played by sow back fat thickness and parity order. At 29 d post-service, sows were mixed into IMPROVED or CONTROL pens with individual feeding stalls (6 groups/treatment, 20 sows/group). Aggressive behavior was recorded for 2 h at mixing (T0) and 24 h (T1) and 3 weeks post-mixing (T21). Overall, the sows in the CONTROL pens performed more fighting behavior compared to the IMPROVED sows (",pubmed,2025-05-20 20:08:58.939

PMC10127498,The burden of non-communicable diseases: A scoping review focus on the context of India,"The mortality rate of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) contributes more in low-income and middle-income countries, also among individuals with lower socioeconomic status in high-income countries, making NCDs a big hurdle to minimizing global and national health disparities. Among 55 million fatalities worldwide in 2019, NCDs accounted for about 41 million (71%) deaths. The purpose of this scoping review was to comprehend the available literature on the burden of NCDs in India. This review included the studies that have been published between the period of 2009–2020. For this review, 18 full-text articles have been selected. A preliminary search was done to obtain articles from the search engines such as PubMed, Google Scholar, web of science, and Scopus. Our scoping review was focused on five major NCDs which are cardiovascular, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and stroke. In 2019, around 17.9 million individuals died from cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is accounting for 32% of all deaths. As compared to Chandigarh and Jharkhand (0.12 million and 0.96 million, respectively) Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra (4.8 million and 9.2 million, respectively) have a higher percentage of the population affected by diabetes. In India, stroke is the fifth-significant cause of disability and the fourth-leading cause of fatality, which is accounting for 3.5 percent of all disabilities. India should construct a higher-level coordinating framework and devise an overarching policy or strategy tailored to NCDs. To limit risk factor exposure, it is necessary to emphasize health promotion and preventive actions.",pubmed,2025-05-20 22:53:10.499

PMC10902441,Glycine is a transmitter in the human and chimpanzee cochlear nuclei,"Auditory information is relayed from the cochlea via the eighth cranial nerve to the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei (DCN, VCN). The organization, neurochemistry and circuitry of the cochlear nuclei (CN) have been studied in many species. It is well-established that glycine is an inhibitory transmitter in the CN of rodents and cats, with glycinergic cells in the DCN and VCN. There are, however, major differences in the laminar and cellular organization of the DCN between humans (and other primates) and rodents and cats. We therefore asked whether there might also be differences in glycinergic neurotransmission in the CN. We studied brainstem sections from humans, chimpanzees, and cats. We used antibodies to glycine receptors (GLYR) to identify neurons receiving glycinergic input, and antibodies to the neuronal glycine transporter (GLYT2) to immunolabel glycinergic axons and terminals. We also examined archival sections immunostained for calretinin (CR) and nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein (NPNFP) to try to locate the octopus cell area (OCA), a region in the VCN that rodents has minimal glycinergic input. In humans and chimpanzees we found widespread immunolabel for glycine receptors in DCN and in the posterior (PVCN) and anterior (AVCN) divisions of the VCN. We found a parallel distribution of GLYT2-immunolabeled fibers and puncta. The data also suggest that, as in rodents, a region containing octopus cells in cats, humans and chimpanzees has little glycinergic input. Our results show that glycine is a major transmitter in the human and chimpanzee CN, despite the species differences in DCN organization. The sources of the glycinergic input to the CN in humans and chimpanzees are not known.",pubmed,2025-05-20 23:02:42.463

12808147,Membrane-binding and activation mechanism of PTEN.,"PTEN is a tumor suppressor that reverses the action of phosphoinositide 3-kinase by catalyzing the removal of the 3' phosphate of phosphoinositides. Despite the critical role of PTEN in cell signaling and regulation, the mechanisms of its membrane recruitment and activation is still poorly understood. PTEN is composed of an N-terminal phosphatase domain, a C2 domain, and a C-terminal tail region that contains the PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 homology (PDZ) domain-binding sequence and multiple phosphorylation sites. Our in vitro surface plasmon resonance measurements using immobilized vesicles showed that both the phosphatase domain and the C2 domain, but not the C-terminal tail, are involved in electrostatic membrane binding of PTEN. Furthermore, the phosphorylation-mimicking mutation on the C-terminal tail of PTEN caused an approximately 80-fold reduction in its membrane affinity, mainly by slowing the membrane-association step. Subcellular localization studies of PTEN transfected into HEK293T and HeLa cells indicated that targeting of PTEN to the plasma membrane is coupled with rapid degradation and that the phosphatase domain and the C2 domain are both necessary and sufficient for its membrane recruitment. Results also indicated that the phosphorylation regulates the targeting of PTEN to the plasma membrane not by blocking the PDZ domain-binding site but by interfering with electrostatic membrane binding of PTEN. On the basis of these results, we propose a membrane-binding and activation mechanism for PTEN, in which the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the C-terminal region serves as an electrostatic switch that controls the membrane translocation of the protein.",pubmed,2025-05-20 23:39:48.862
