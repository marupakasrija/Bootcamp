# This is abstraction-level-4/processors/snake.py
# Contains a simple line processor function (str -> str).

# This file is a submodule of the 'processors' package, which is
# a submodule of the 'abstraction_level4' package.

# No imports from the parent package needed here for this simple function.
# If you needed to import types or other modules from abstraction_level4,
# you would use relative imports like:
# from ..types import ProcessorFn # To import from abstraction_level4.types
