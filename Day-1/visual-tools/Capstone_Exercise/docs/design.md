# ChoiceMate Design Document

**Problem:** Online shoppers are often overwhelmed by the vast number of products on e-commerce platforms and struggle to find items that truly match their specific needs and preferences using traditional search and filtering. Existing recommendation systems are often generic or limited to a single platform.

**Goals:**
* Develop a system that understands user needs through natural language conversation.
* Provide personalized product recommendations from multiple e-commerce platforms (initially Amazon and Flipkart).
* Deliver recommendations based on real-time product data.
* Offer a user-friendly chat interface for product discovery.
* Enable direct access to product pages for purchase.

**Non-Goals:**
* Processing transactions or handling payments directly.
* Replacing the core functionality of e-commerce platforms.
* Providing customer support for purchased products.
* Handling returns or order management.

**Options:**
* **Option 1 (Chosen):** MERN stack for full-stack development, Python for data processing (scraping, ML model), Gemini API for conversational AI. This leverages strong JavaScript ecosystem for the web app and powerful Python libraries for data tasks, integrating a state-of-the-art AI model.
* **Option 2:** Use a single language/framework (e.g., Python with Django/Flask for backend and a Python-based frontend framework). Might simplify the stack but could limit access to certain libraries or community support compared to MERN for web development.
* **Option 3:** Rely solely on existing e-commerce APIs (if available and suitable) instead of scraping. This would be more stable but might limit the scope of data available or platforms supported.

**Decision:** Option 1 was chosen to combine the strengths of the MERN stack for a responsive web application with Python's data handling capabilities and the advanced natural language understanding of the Gemini API.

**Risks:**
* **Web Scraping Instability:** E-commerce websites frequently change their structure, breaking scrapers. Bot detection mechanisms can also block scraping.
* **API Limitations:** Reliance on external APIs (Gemini) introduces dependency and potential costs or usage limits.
* **ML Model Accuracy:** The relevance and quality of recommendations depend heavily on the training data and model effectiveness, which may require continuous refinement.
* **Data Privacy & Compliance:** Handling user data and scraping requires careful consideration of privacy regulations and terms of service.
* **Scalability:** Scaling real-time scraping and AI processing for a large number of concurrent users could be challenging.
